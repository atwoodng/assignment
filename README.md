Hello, here is some of my python and R code. 

Most of file under "basic R programming" written 1 years ago. It is mainly assignments of some R programming course. 
I have written more code in R but i havent saved most of them. 

Python is the second programming language i have ever learnt. The programming assignment was put in python hw folder.

Learning from data is my recent attending course about machine learning. 

Most of the code has fews comment and may look pretty messy. Sorry for that. I dont plan to share all these code orginally. I will try to tidy them up when i have time.
